sublime-settings
================

My sublime settings.

I develop mainly on windows and just use a junction to set get these files in the correct place.

C:\Users\[Username]>mklink /J "c:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages
" "c:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\sublime-settings"

In mac

sudo ln -s ~/git/sublime-settings/ ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
